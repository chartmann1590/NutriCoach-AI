                    <h2>AI-Generated Content</h2>
                    <p>
                        NutriCoach uses artificial intelligence to provide nutrition coaching and food recommendations. While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated content:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>May contain errors or inaccuracies</li>

                    <h2>Food Recognition Limitations</h2>
                    <p>
                        The photo-based food recognition feature uses AI technology to identify foods and estimate nutritional content. This feature:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides estimates that may not be accurate</li>
                        <li>Cannot account for cooking methods, ingredients, or portion sizes with complete accuracy</li>
                        <li>Should be used as a starting point and verified against reliable nutrition databases</li>
                        <li>May misidentify foods or provide incorrect nutritional information</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Allergies and Dietary Restrictions</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you have food allergies, intolerances, or dietary restrictions, always verify ingredient information independently. NutriCoach's food database and AI recommendations may not capture all allergens or dietary considerations. When in doubt, consult food labels and manufacturers directly.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Emergency Situations</h2>
                    <p>
